buttons on hand: sort by number or by color.

bugs:
weird error typescript array any phases[phase] in TableSet.vue (solved: punted and used javascript)

idea:
improve accessibility of game by having "suits" on cards, just some symbol for each color.

issue:
I've been including "playerId" on websocket requests, started implementing that...
but the problem is subscribing and responding to stuff.
If the websocket id changes and playerId stays the same, messages won't get back to the client unless the new socket id joins.
So i guess I could join it to the room every time.

I should probably also really think about authentication at this point.

The problem I'm running into is that development is super slow when I have to recreate the whole gamestate in the client every time I make any change to server-side code. That's a huge pain.
Makes it impossible to debug the server in any kind of efficient manner.
